Fundamentals of Streaming with Kinesis
- more of an overview for kinesis
- explains benefits of streaming data in real-time or near real-time
	- Streaming reduces need for large and expensive shared databases. This is because every stream consumer maintains its own data and state
	- Stream processing fits naturally inside a decoupled microservices architecture
	- Can provide actionable insights within _milliseconds_ of a recorded event
- Questions to consider when deciding whether to use stream processing
	- How important is it to have immediate insights?
		- For example, a bug ticketing system probably does not need real-time streams
		- However, banks, healthcare, and security services do require real-time or near real-time streaming data (i.e. fraudulent transactions, a hospital patient needs immediate assistance, there's a security breach or vulernability)
- Challenges of Stream Processing
	- Streaming applications are usually "high-touch" systems (lots of human interaction) which make the application inconsistent and difficult to automate
	- Difficult to set up - streaming apps usually have lots of brittle components
	- Expensive to create, maintain, and scale in on-premises datacenters
