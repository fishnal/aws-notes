# Logging

- Invaluable for auditing and governance
- Helps resolves incidents since logs provide information before and after the incident occurred
- Logs can trigger automatic responses or alerts (especially useful for real-time logs)
- Provides transparency into how your resources in the cloud are interacting with each other
