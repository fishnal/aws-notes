# EC2 Instance Store Volumes

* Instance store volumes provide ephemeral (temporary) storage
* If instance is stopped or teminated, then data is lost
* If instance is rebooted, the data is in-tact
* Fast I/O speeds
  * Can be good for caching
* No additional cost for storage, it's included in the price of your EC2 instance
* Can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances
