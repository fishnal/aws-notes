- Backup and Restore
- Pilot Light - a very small replica of critical systems is partially running, but requires additional deployments before handling traffic.
- Warm Standby - a scaled-down version of your complete system
- Multi-Site - complete copies of your system (at full-scale) deployed elsewhere, most expensive
